## Download
Get the app from our [releases page](https://github.com/kodjodevf/mangayomi/releases).


## Using Rust Inside Flutter

This project use Rust for the [auto-image-cropper](https://github.com/ritiek/auto-image-cropper) crate utilizing the capabilities of the [Rinf](https://pub.dev/packages/rinf) framework.

To run and build this app, you need to have
[Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
and [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
installed on your system.
You can check that your system is ready with the commands below.
Note that all the Flutter subcomponents should be installed.

```bash
rustc --version
flutter doctor
```

You also need to have the CLI tool for Rinf ready.

```bash
cargo install rinf
```

Messages sent between Dart and Rust are implemented using Protobuf.
If you have newly cloned the project repository
or made changes to the `.proto` files in the `./messages` directory,
run the following command:

```bash
rinf message
```

Now you can run and build this app just like any other Flutter projects.

```bash
flutter run
```

For detailed instructions on writing Rust and Flutter together,
please refer to Rinf's [documentation](https://rinf-docs.cunarist.com).
